# Alright, lets do this.
Your first large assignment: you will build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. Below details a short style guide; follow it to design an aesthetically pleasing layout while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements. IF you are feeling comfortable with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, branch out and challenge yourself! You dont have to copy the example. 

# Preparation

* This is your first project as a front-end developer. You will be working closely with an important client - yourself. Creating and maintaining a strong portfolio is a great first step in building your web development brand.

* This will be tough, if only because you're probably still getting comfortable with web design. Trust me, it gets easier. You'll start to read and understand code like you do with plain english. Practice makes perfect. Challenge yourself on this project and laugh in a few weeks time.

* Make a plan. There are a lot... and I mean a *looot* of wireframe tools online you can use for free. There's also good ol' pen and paper :)

# Instructions

**EXAMPLE** 
* Look at the images in the `i_portfolioDemo` folder. Use these as inspiration for your portfolio. 

*** AT MINIMUM, your portfolio needs to match the demo** 

1. Make a new repo in GitHub called `Static-Portfolio`.

2. Clone into this new repo on your machine, using the method practiced in class.

3. Inside the `Static-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine, create *AT MINIMUM* :
   * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
   * A folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
   * Remember... `git add .` then  `git commit -m "something like: initial site files"` and once all files are committed (the repo on github now matches the local repo) `git push origin main` to push (overwrite) your changes to your GitHub repo.

5. Create and deploy your pages to GitHub pages: 
   * A main page that summarizes you, your ambitions, and your expertise. Use this as a landing page to grab your audience's attention, and leave all the details 
       for the content pages.

   * A 'My Work' page which features your projects. Use placeholder images and titles for at least FIVE projects. This page should be fully styled
       and you will be updating the placeholders for your real projects as we go throughout the program.

   * A 'Contact Me' page which will allow the user to send you a message. Dont worry about the functionality yet, just focus on getting the page looking the way you 
       want it so later on all we will need to do is add the required JavaScript. 

   * Your website should be fully navigable. 

   * Once you are finished, upload your portfolio onto GitHub pages, and send me the link.


# Some General Wisdom

* When creating a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS or adding Bootstrap AND to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. 

* Write your HTML semantically:
   * If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * and so on.

* When it is time to style, START WITH A LAYOUT AND GO FROM THERE. There are *tons* of free tools to help you plan out a wireframe and visualize a page. 

* The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.
   * A main page that summarizes you, your ambitions, and your expertise. Use this as a landing page to grab your audience's attention, and leave all the details 
     for the content pages.

* Commit and push your changes to Github often. This is a great habit to get into. You can NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL. When working on a project, I try to commit and push my code every time I:
   * finish a file, or a feature in a file
   * when I walk away from the computer for longer than a few minutes

# Stylin'

* Colors
   * Use the Color Picker Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages. 
   * Adobe has a cool color theme builder. If you are like me (not v good with aesthetics) this is a valuable tool (https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

* Images
   * You should have some sort of profile picture on `index.html`:
      * Use a picture of yourself.
      * If you dont have a picture of yourself, get one.
      * If you really dont want to, you can grab a placeholder image from (http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

   * Portfolio Images
      * Placeholder images can be found at (http://lorempixel.com/).
      * Save the images to your `images` folder.

* Background
   * The background pattern in the example was found on (https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.
   * Or, you can find, make or conjure up any background you'd like. Remember, this is a professional portfolio. If you are serious about it now, this can be a resource for you      indefinitely. 
   * That being said, careful of copywrite.
   

* Dimensions
   * While Bootstrap has a *lot* of responsiveness built in, you may need to add in some media queries. I will be checking for responsiveness!
   * To maximize screen potential across popular sizes, I recommend that your content sections should be `960px` wide.
   * Page Ruler  extension to measure the size of elements. (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en)
   
* While Bootstrap often can handle a lot of our positioning and formatting, dont forget about your friends `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.

# You got this
* This will be a tough assignment, but a few weeks from now, you'll look back to this assignment and laugh. You got this.

* If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in our class channel so your fellow developers can help you. You should aim to have a solid understanding of everything we have covered. Moving forward, we wont really be working on learning styling or layouts, so make sure you are learning and practicing outside class. You have all the tools you need to explore the different things you can do with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

**Good Luck**
